Create a gateway VPC endpoint to the S3 bucket.</strong></p><h3 id="explanation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#explanation"><span>Explanation:</span></a></h3><p>To allow an EC2 instance in a VPC to access an S3 bucket without needing internet connectivity, you can use a <strong>VPC endpoint</strong>. Specifically, a <strong>gateway VPC endpoint</strong> is designed to provide private network connectivity between your VPC and Amazon S3 (and DynamoDB) without using the internet.</p><ul><li><p><strong>B. Stream the logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Export the logs to the S3 bucket.</strong></p><ul><li>This option does not directly address the need for private connectivity between the EC2 instance and S3. It involves routing logs to CloudWatch, which may not be necessary if direct access to S3 is required.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>C. Create an instance profile on Amazon EC2 to allow S3 access.</strong></p><ul><li>An instance profile allows EC2 instances to assume an IAM role for permissions to access S3, but this does not provide private network connectivity. You still need an endpoint like a VPC endpoint for private access to S3.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>D. Create an Amazon API Gateway API with a private link to access the S3 endpoint.</strong></p><ul><li>API Gateway and PrivateLink are typically used for private access to services within VPCs, but creating an API Gateway for accessing S3 is unnecessary and complex compared to simply using a VPC endpoint.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Thus, creating a <strong>gateway VPC endpoint</strong> is the simplest and most efficient solution for providing private network connectivity to S3.</p><h2 id="question2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#question2"><span>Question2</span></a></h2><p>A company collects data for temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure in cities across multiple continents. The average volume of data that the company collects from each site daily is 500 GB. Each site has a high-speed Internet connection.<br> The company wants to aggregate the data from all these global sites as quickly as possible in a single Amazon S3 bucket. The solution must minimize operational complexity.<br> Which solution meets these requirements?</p><ul><li>A. Turn on S3 Transfer Acceleration on the destination S3 bucket. Use multipart uploads to directly upload site data to the destination S3 bucket.</li><li>B. Upload the data from each site to an S3 bucket in the closest Region. Use S3 Cross-Region Replication to copy objects to the destination S3 bucket. Then remove the data from the origin S3 bucket.</li><li>C. Schedule AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device jobs daily to transfer data from each site to the closest Region. Use S3 Cross-Region Replication to copy objects to the destination S3 bucket.</li><li>D. Upload the data from each site to an Amazon EC2 instance in the closest Region. Store the data in an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. At regular intervals, take an EBS snapshot and copy it to the Region that contains the destination S3 bucket. Restore the EBS volume in that Region.</li></ul><h3 id="answer-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#answer-1"><span>Answer:</span></a></h3><p><strong>A. Turn on S3 Transfer Acceleration on the destination S3 bucket. Use multipart uploads to directly upload site data to the destination S3 bucket.</strong></p><h3 id="explanation-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#explanation-1"><span>Explanation:</span></a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Option A</strong> is the best solution because <strong>S3 Transfer Acceleration</strong> speeds up the upload process for large amounts of data over long distances. By using <strong>multipart uploads</strong>, you can upload large files in parallel, improving throughput and efficiency. This solution minimizes operational complexity as it directly uploads to S3 without additional services or manual processes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Option B</strong> involves using <strong>S3 Cross-Region Replication</strong>, which introduces unnecessary complexity by replicating data across regions. While it can be useful for disaster recovery, it&#39;s not as efficient for a simple data aggregation task.</p></li><li><p><strong>Option C</strong> involves using <strong>AWS Snowball Edge</strong>, which is a physical data transfer solution. This is more complex and would be slower than using direct uploads for daily data aggregation, especially since the sites have high-speed Internet connections.</p></li><li><p><strong>Option D</strong> is overly complex, as it involves setting up EC2 instances, EBS volumes, and taking snapshots. This is far more complicated than directly uploading the data to S3 using transfer acceleration.</p></li></ul><p>Thus, <strong>Option A</strong> is the most suitable solution for aggregating data with minimal complexity and high speed.</p><h2 id="question3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#question3"><span>Question3</span></a></h2><p>A company needs the ability to analyze the log files of its proprietary application. The logs are stored in JSON format in an Amazon S3 bucket. Queries will be simple and will run on-demand. A solutions architect needs to perform the analysis with minimal changes to the existing architecture.<br> What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead?</p><ul><li>A. Use Amazon Redshift to load all the content into one place and run the SQL queries as needed.</li><li>B. Use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to store the logs. Run SQL queries as needed from the Amazon CloudWatch console.</li><li>C. Use Amazon Athena directly with Amazon S3 to run the queries as needed.</li><li>D. Use AWS Glue to catalog the logs. Use a transient Apache Spark cluster on Amazon EMR to run the SQL queries as needed.</li></ul><h3 id="answer-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#answer-2"><span>Answer:</span></a></h3><p><strong>C. Use Amazon Athena directly with Amazon S3 to run the queries as needed.</strong></p><h3 id="explanation-2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#explanation-2"><span>Explanation:</span></a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Option C</strong> is the best choice as <strong>Amazon Athena</strong> allows you to run SQL queries directly on data stored in <strong>Amazon S3</strong>. Since the logs are already stored in S3 in JSON format, Athena can query this data without needing to move it or change the existing architecture. Athena is fully managed and requires minimal operational overhead. It is ideal for simple, on-demand queries and provides a straightforward solution for this use case.</p></li><li><p><strong>Option A</strong> (Amazon Redshift) would require loading the logs into Redshift, which introduces additional complexity and overhead to set up and manage the Redshift cluster. It is more suited for complex analytics and data warehousing, not for simple log analysis.</p></li><li><p><strong>Option B</strong> (Amazon CloudWatch Logs) would require moving the logs to CloudWatch, which introduces additional complexity for log management and is more suited for logs that need to be actively monitored, rather than for on-demand query-based analysis.</p></li><li><p><strong>Option D</strong> (AWS Glue + Apache Spark on Amazon EMR) involves setting up AWS Glue for cataloging and running queries on an EMR cluster, which introduces significant operational overhead for simple log queries. This solution would be much more complex than necessary for on-demand queries on S3 data.</p></li></ul><p>Thus, <strong>Option C</strong> is the most efficient and cost-effective solution for running simple, on-demand queries on JSON log data stored in Amazon S3.</p><h2 id="question4" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#question4"><span>Question4</span></a></h2><p>A company uses AWS Organizations to manage multiple AWS accounts for different departments.

Add the aws:PrincipalOrgID global condition key with a reference to the organization ID to the S3 bucket policy.</strong></p><h3 id="explanation-3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#explanation-3"><span>Explanation:</span></a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Option A</strong> is the most efficient solution because the <strong><code>aws:PrincipalOrgID</code></strong> condition key in the S3 bucket policy allows you to restrict access based on the AWS Organization ID. This ensures that only users from accounts within the specified organization can access the S3 bucket, without needing to manually manage tags, monitor account events, or create organizational units. This is the least operationally complex solution.</p></li><li><p><strong>Option B</strong> introduces unnecessary complexity by requiring the creation of organizational units (OUs) for each department and adding additional conditions. While this could work, it is more complicated than using the organization ID directly.</p></li><li><p><strong>Option C</strong> involves using <strong>AWS CloudTrail</strong> to monitor account-related events. While this could be used to track account changes, it does not directly address the requirement of restricting access to the S3 bucket, and would require additional operational overhead to monitor and update the bucket policy based on those events.</p></li><li><p><strong>Option D</strong> requires tagging each user and adding a condition in the S3 bucket policy to check those tags. While this can work, it introduces additional manual overhead in managing tags for each user and does not directly leverage the organizational structure for access control.</p></li></ul><p>Thus, <strong>Option A</strong> provides the simplest and most operationally efficient way to restrict access to the S3 bucket based on the AWS Organization ID.</p><h2 id="question5" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#question5"><span>Question5</span></a></h2><p>A company is hosting a web application on AWS using a single Amazon EC2 instance that stores user-uploaded documents in an Amazon EBS volume.

By using Amazon EFS, both EC2 instances in different Availability Zones will have access to the same set of documents, ensuring that users can see all of their documents no matter which EC2 instance handles their request. This solution also removes the need for complex data synchronization between EBS volumes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Option A</strong> suggests copying the data to both EBS volumes, which would introduce complexity and might not be scalable, as each EC2 instance would need to maintain its own copy of the data. Additionally, this could lead to data inconsistency issues.</p></li><li><p><strong>Option B</strong> suggests configuring the Application Load Balancer to direct users to the server with the required documents, but this doesn’t address the core issue of sharing data between the EC2 instances.
