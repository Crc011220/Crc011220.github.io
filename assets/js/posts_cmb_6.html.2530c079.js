Common reasoning tasks include arithmetic reasoning, common sense reasoning, and symbolic reasoning. Unlike ordinary Few-Shot which only uses ⟨input, output⟩ pairs to construct prompts, chain-of-thought prompting further integrates intermediate reasoning steps to guide the reasoning process from input to output. As an extension of contextual learning, chain-of-thought prompting transforms the original ⟨input, output⟩ mapping relationship into a ⟨input, chain-of-thought, output⟩ triplet form.</p></li><li><p>Other Prompting Techniques</p></li></ol><ul><li>Clarify the task or requirement: Clearly specify the goal or task you want the generated text to achieve in the prompt, such as description, explanation, comparison, summary, etc. Example: Please describe the history and development process of China Merchant Bank.</li><li>Prohibitions: Specify particular topics, fields, or backgrounds in the prompt to ensure the model generates content related to them. Example: Introduce the existing public funds in the market, but do not recommend financial products to clients.</li><li>Specify format or structure: If you have specific text format or structure requirements, you can clearly specify them in the prompt, such as lists, paragraphs, headings, etc. Example: Write an investment research report on Country Garden, including introduction, body, and conclusion.</li><li>Determine tone or style: If you want the generated text to have a specific tone, style, or manner, you can express it clearly in the prompt. Example: Introduce the current market situation to clients in a formal style.</li><li>Specify key information or elements: Provide key information or elements in the prompt to ensure the generated text includes the required content. Example: Provide detailed fund information, including fund manager, investment style, and investment targets.</li></ul>',22)]))}]]),s=JSON.parse('{"path":"/posts/cmb/6.html","title":"Week 6","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"icon":"pen-to-square","date":"2025-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","category":["Internship journal"],"tag":["China Merchant Bank"],"description":"Week 6 Document security check API Reconstruct the code to reduce the complexity and satisfy the coding standard Adjust the return format Auto-generation of project designing do...","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://crc011220.github.io/personalweb/personalweb/posts/cmb/6.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"Richard Chen"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Week 6"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Week 6 Document security check API Reconstruct the code to reduce the complexity and satisfy the coding standard Adjust the return format Auto-generation of project designing do..."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2025-01-13T10:29:29.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"China Merchant Bank"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2025-01-13T00:00:00.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2025-01-13T10:29:29.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"Week 6\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2025-01-13T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":\\"2025-01-13T10:29:29.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[{\\"@type\\":\\"Person\\",\\"name\\":\\"Richard Chen\\"}]}"]]},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Document security check API","slug":"document-security-check-api","link":"#document-security-check-api","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Auto-generation of project designing documents","slug":"auto-generation-of-project-designing-documents","link":"#auto-generation-of-project-designing-documents","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Tecnical points","slug":"tecnical-points","link":"#tecnical-points","children":[]}],"git":{"createdTime":1736764169000,"updatedTime":1736764169000,"contributors":[{"name":"Ruochen Chen","email":"ruocchen1220@gmail.com","commits":1}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":2.48,"words":743},"filePathRelative":"posts/cmb/6.md","localizedDate":"January 13, 2025","excerpt":"\\n<h2>Document security check API</h2>\\n<h4>Reconstruct the code to reduce the complexity and satisfy the coding standard</h4>\\n<h4>Adjust the return format</h4>\\n<h2>Auto-generation of project designing documents</h2>\\n<h4>Read prompt engineering document in CMB</h4>\\n<h4>Think how to use prompt engineering document to generate a comprehensive project designing documents</h4>","autoDesc":true}')}}]);
