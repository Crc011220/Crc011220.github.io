The main goals of RAID include:</p><ol><li>Improving performance: By distributing data across multiple disks, RAID can increase data read and write speeds, as multiple disks can operate simultaneously.</li><li>Enhancing reliability: Through data redundancy, RAID can protect data in the event of disk failure, preventing data loss.</li><li>Expanding capacity: By combining multiple disks into a single logical unit, RAID can provide greater storage capacity than a single disk.</li></ol><p>RAID has various levels, each with its specific advantages and disadvantages, suitable for different application scenarios.

However, storage capacity is halved because each data block needs to be stored on multiple disks.</li><li>RAID 5: Data striping with parity, which distributes data and parity information across multiple disks to improve performance and reliability.

It achieves this by requiring transactions to obtain the necessary locks before reading or modifying data and releasing these locks after the transaction is completed. The two-phase locking protocol divides the execution of a transaction into two phases:</p><ol><li><strong>Growing Phase</strong>: In this phase, a transaction can acquire locks but cannot release any locks. The transaction requests and obtains all the locks it needs. This phase ensures that transactions do not interfere with each other due to resource contention during execution.</li><li><strong>Shrinking Phase</strong>: In this phase, a transaction can release locks but cannot acquire any new locks. The transaction begins to release the locks it previously acquired after completing all necessary operations. This phase ensures that transactions do not have new impacts on other transactions before committing or rolling back. Based on the type and release time of locks, two-phase locking can be divided into several variants:</li></ol><ul><li><strong>Strict 2PL</strong>: All exclusive locks (X locks) held by a transaction are not released until the transaction commits or rolls back. This ensures that transactions are not visible to other transactions before committing, thus avoiding dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.</li><li><strong>Rigorous 2PL</strong>: All locks (including shared locks S locks and exclusive locks X locks) held by a transaction are not released until the transaction commits or rolls back. This is the strictest 2PL variant, providing the highest level of isolation.</li><li><strong>Conservative 2PL</strong>: A transaction must acquire all the locks it needs before it starts. This can prevent transactions from being blocked due to waiting for locks during execution. The two-phase locking protocol is a key technology for achieving the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) of transactions, especially in ensuring isolation. However, it may also lead to deadlocks, requiring additional mechanisms to detect and resolve deadlock issues.</li></ul><h3 id="log-record-buffering" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#log-record-buffering"><span>Log Record Buffering</span></a></h3><ol><li><strong>Log Record Buffering</strong>: <ul><li>Log records are buffered in main memory.</li><li>Log records can be output with a single output operation.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Log Force</strong>: <ul><li>Perform log force operations to commit transactions.</li><li>Force all log records (including commit records) to be written to stable storage.</li></ul></li></ol><h3 id="issues-with-database-buffering" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#issues-with-database-buffering"><span>Issues with Database Buffering</span></a></h3><ol><li><strong>Removing existing blocks when the buffer is full</strong>: <ul><li>When new data blocks are needed and the buffer is full, existing data blocks must be removed from the buffer.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Write-back strategy for updated blocks</strong>: <ul><li>If the selected block has been updated, the write operation must be completed before outputting it to disk.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Handling uncommitted updates</strong>: <ul><li>If a block with uncommitted updates is output to disk, log records containing undo information must first be output to stable log storage (Write-Ahead Logging, WAL).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Avoid ongoing updates</strong>: <ul><li>There should be no ongoing update operations when outputting data blocks to disk.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Use of locks</strong>: <ul><li>Before writing a data item, a transaction acquires an exclusive lock on the block containing the data item to ensure no interference from other transactions.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Locks held for a short time are called latches</strong>: <ul><li>This type of lock is typically used to control short-term access to shared resources.
