Option B (Amazon CloudWatch Logs): CloudWatch Logs does not support direct SQL querying capabilities and is better suited for monitoring, not for data analytics over large volumes of data. Option C (Amazon Athena): Athena provides a cost-effective, serverless way to query S3 data using SQL without additional management or setup, making it ideal for on-demand querying of JSON log files in S3. Option D (AWS Glue with Amazon EMR): AWS Glue can catalog data, but using Amazon EMR with Spark clusters for transient jobs adds complexity and operational overhead compared to the serverless nature of Athena.</p></div>',5)]))}]]),r=JSON.parse('{"path":"/posts/aws-saa/1.html","title":"AWS Solution Architect Associate","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"icon":"pen-to-square","date":"2024-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","category":["Learning Records"],"tag":["AWS Solution Architect Associate"],"description":"AWS Solution Architect Associate Error review notes A company needs the ability to analyze the log files of its proprietary application.
