It is used to record the address of the currently executing bytecode instruction. <code>javap -verbose xx.class</code> prints the stack size, the number of local variables, and the method parameters. The Java Virtual Machine handles multithreading by switching between threads and allocating execution time. At any given moment, a processor will only execute one thread. If the currently executing thread runs out of its allocated execution time, it will be suspended, and the processor will switch to another thread. When that thread&#39;s execution time is also exhausted, the processor will return to execute the suspended thread. Now, the question arises: how does the current processor know where the suspended thread last executed? This is where the program counter comes in, allowing the current thread to return to the last executed line number and continue execution. The program counter is the only area in the JVM specification that does not have a defined OutOfMemoryError (OOM) condition, so this space will not undergo garbage collection (GC).</p><h2 id="_1-3-what-is-the-java-heap" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-3-what-is-the-java-heap"><span>1.3 What is the Java heap?</span></a></h2><p>The heap is a shared area among threads, primarily used to store object instances, arrays, etc. When there is no memory space available in the heap to allocate to an instance and it cannot be expanded, an OutOfMemoryError exception is thrown.</p><ul><li>The young generation is divided into three parts: the Eden space and two equally sized Survivor spaces.

To avoid OOM in the method area, in Java 8, the method area (Permanent Generation) on the heap was moved to local memory, creating a new space called Metaspace. This change helps to avoid OOM occurrences.</li></ul><h3 id="introduction-to-metaspace" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#introduction-to-metaspace"><span>Introduction to Metaspace</span></a></h3><p>In the HotSpot JVM, the Permanent Generation (≈ Method Area) is used to store metadata about classes and methods, as well as the constant pool, such as Class and Method. Whenever a class is loaded for the first time, its metadata is placed in the Permanent Generation. The Permanent Generation has a size limit, so if too many classes are loaded, it can lead to memory overflow, resulting in an OutOfMemoryError, necessitating tuning of the virtual machine. Removing the Permanent Generation was an effort to merge the HotSpot JVM with the JRockit VM, as JRockit does not have a Permanent Generation and does not require configuration for it.</p><ol><li>Since PermGen memory often overflows, causing OutOfMemoryError, JVM developers wanted this memory to be managed more flexibly to avoid frequent OOM occurrences.</li><li>Removing PermGen facilitates the integration of HotSpot JVM with JRockit VM, as JRockit does not have a Permanent Generation. Specifically, the string constant pool in the Perm area was moved to heap memory after Java 7, and in Java 8, PermGen was replaced by Metaspace. Other contents, such as class metadata, fields, static properties, methods, constants, etc., were moved to the Metaspace area. For example, class metadata for <code>java/lang/Object</code>, static property <code>System.out</code>, integer constants, etc. The essence of Metaspace is similar to that of the Permanent Generation, both being implementations of the method area in the JVM specification. However, the biggest difference between Metaspace and the Permanent Generation is that Metaspace is not located in the virtual machine but uses local memory. Therefore, by default, the size of Metaspace is only limited by local memory.</li></ol><h2 id="_1-4-java-virtual-machine-stacks" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-4-java-virtual-machine-stacks"><span>1.4 Java Virtual Machine Stacks</span></a></h2><ul><li>The memory required for each thread during execution is called the virtual machine stack, which follows a last-in, first-out (LIFO) structure.</li><li>Each stack consists of multiple stack frames, corresponding to the memory occupied by each method call.</li><li>Each thread can only have one active stack frame, corresponding to the currently executing method. <img src="'+n+'" alt="thread-safe.jpg" loading="lazy"></li></ul><h3 id="stack-memory-overflow-situations" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#stack-memory-overflow-situations"><span>Stack Memory Overflow Situations</span></a></h3><ul><li>Stack frames can overflow due to excessive stack frames, a typical issue being recursive calls.</li></ul><div class="language-java line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="shiki" data-ext="java" data-title="java" style="--shiki-light:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#abb2bf;--shiki-light-bg:#FAFAFA;--shiki-dark-bg:#282c34;"><pre class="shiki shiki-themes one-light one-dark-pro vp-code"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-light:#A626A4;--shiki-dark:#C678DD;">public</span><span style="--shiki-light:#A626A4;--shiki-dark:#C678DD;"> static</span><span style="--shiki-light:#A626A4;--shiki-dark:#C678DD;"> void</span><span style="--shiki-light:#4078F2;--shiki-dark:#61AFEF;"> method</span><span style="--shiki-light:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#E06C75;">(){</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span style="--shiki-light:#4078F2;--shiki-dark:#61AFEF;">    method</span><span style="--shiki-light:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#E06C75;">()</span><span style="--shiki-light:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#ABB2BF;">;</span></span>\n<span class="line"><span style="--shiki-light:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#E06C75;">}</span></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><ul><li>Stack memory can overflow due to excessively large stack frames.</li></ul><h2 id="_1-5-jvm-runtime-data-area" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-5-jvm-runtime-data-area"><span>1.5 JVM Runtime Data Area</span></a></h2><p>Components include: heap, method area, stack, native method stack, and program counter.</p><ol><li>The heap addresses the problem of storing object instances and is the main area managed by the garbage collector.</li><li>The method area can be considered a part of the heap, used to store information loaded by the virtual machine, constants, static variables, and code compiled by the just-in-time compiler.</li><li>The stack addresses the problem of program execution, storing stack frames, which contain local variable tables, operand stacks, dynamic links, method exits, and other information.</li><li>The native method stack functions similarly to the stack, executing native methods, which are interfaces for Java to call non-Java code.</li><li>The program counter (PC register) stores the line number of the bytecode currently being executed by the thread.

What is GC and why is it needed?</span></a></h2><p>To allow programmers to focus more on code implementation without worrying excessively about memory release, Java has an automatic garbage collection mechanism, commonly known as GC (Garbage Collection). With garbage collection, programmers only need to concern themselves with memory allocation; the system automatically identifies when to release memory. During garbage collection, different object reference types trigger GC at different times. In other words, the algorithms for automatic garbage collection become very important. If the algorithms are unreasonable, leading to memory resources not being released, it can also cause memory overflow. Other languages, such as C# and Python, also have automatic garbage collection mechanisms.</p><h2 id="_3-2-when-can-an-object-be-garbage-collected" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-2-when-can-an-object-be-garbage-collected"><span>3.2 When can an object be garbage collected?</span></a></h2><p>If one or more objects have no references pointing to them, then these objects are considered garbage and may be collected by the garbage collector.

Objects have a method called <code>finalize</code>. When an object is marked for collection, during GC, it first checks whether the <code>finalize</code> method has been executed. If it has not been executed, this method will be called first. In this method, the current object can establish a connection with GC ROOTS. After this method completes, GC will check again if the object is reachable. If it is still unreachable, it will be collected; if it is reachable, it will not be collected. The <code>finalize</code> method is executed only once for each object. If the first time this method is executed, the current object is associated with RC ROOTS, it will not be collected this time.
