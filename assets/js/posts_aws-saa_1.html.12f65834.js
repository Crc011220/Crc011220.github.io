It involves routing logs to CloudWatch, which may not be necessary if direct access to S3 is required.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>C. Create an instance profile on Amazon EC2 to allow S3 access.</strong></p><ul><li>An instance profile allows EC2 instances to assume an IAM role for permissions to access S3, but this does not provide private network connectivity. You still need an endpoint like a VPC endpoint for private access to S3.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>D. Create an Amazon API Gateway API with a private link to access the S3 endpoint.</strong></p><ul><li>API Gateway and PrivateLink are typically used for private access to services within VPCs, but creating an API Gateway for accessing S3 is unnecessary and complex compared to simply using a VPC endpoint.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Thus, creating a <strong>gateway VPC endpoint</strong> is the simplest and most efficient solution for providing private network connectivity to S3.</p><h2 id="question2" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#question2"><span>Question2</span></a></h2><p>A company collects data for temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure in cities across multiple continents.

By using <strong>multipart uploads</strong>, you can upload large files in parallel, improving throughput and efficiency. This solution minimizes operational complexity as it directly uploads to S3 without additional services or manual processes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Option B</strong> involves using <strong>S3 Cross-Region Replication</strong>, which introduces unnecessary complexity by replicating data across regions. While it can be useful for disaster recovery, it&#39;s not as efficient for a simple data aggregation task.</p></li><li><p><strong>Option C</strong> involves using <strong>AWS Snowball Edge</strong>, which is a physical data transfer solution. This is more complex and would be slower than using direct uploads for daily data aggregation, especially since the sites have high-speed Internet connections.</p></li><li><p><strong>Option D</strong> is overly complex, as it involves setting up EC2 instances, EBS volumes, and taking snapshots.

This ensures that only users from accounts within the specified organization can access the S3 bucket, without needing to manually manage tags, monitor account events, or create organizational units.

When a user uploads an image through the web interface, the microservice should store the image in an Amazon S3 bucket, process and compress the image with an AWS Lambda function, and store the image in its compressed form in a different S3 bucket. A solutions architect needs to design a solution that uses durable, stateless components to process the images automatically. Which combination of actions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)</p><ul><li><strong>A. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure the S3 bucket to send a notification to the SQS queue when an image is uploaded to the S3 bucket.</strong></li><li><strong>B. Configure the Lambda function to use the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as the invocation source.

This ensures that the Lambda function is only invoked when there is work to do, and it can handle multiple messages concurrently. Deleting the message from the queue after successful processing ensures that the message is not processed again, maintaining idempotency.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="why-other-options-are-less-suitable-3" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-other-options-are-less-suitable-3"><span>Why Other Options Are Less Suitable:</span></a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Option C</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Lambda Function Monitoring S3 Bucket</strong>: While this approach can work, it is less efficient and more complex compared to using an SQS queue.

Create a new route table that excludes the route to the public subnets&#39; CIDR blocks. Associate the route table with the database subnets</strong>:</p><ul><li>Route tables control how traffic is routed within a VPC but do not enforce access controls based on source or destination IP addresses. This option does not provide the necessary security isolation required.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>B. Create a security group that denies inbound traffic from the security group that is assigned to instances in the public subnets. Attach the security group to the DB instances</strong>:</p><ul><li>Denying specific traffic can be less secure and more complex to manage. A better approach is to explicitly allow only the necessary traffic, as done in Option C.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>D. Create a new peering connection between the public subnets and the private subnets. Create a different peering connection between the private subnets and the database subnets</strong>:</p><ul><li>Peering connections are used to connect VPCs or different regions, not subnets within the same VPC.

By creating a listener rule specifically for HTTP traffic (port 80), you can set up a redirection action to automatically redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS (port 443).</li></ul><h3 id="why-other-options-are-less-suitable-12" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-other-options-are-less-suitable-12"><span>Why Other Options Are Less Suitable</span></a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>A. Update the ALB&#39;s network ACL to accept only HTTPS traffic</strong>:</p><ul><li>Network ACLs operate at the subnet level and can block or allow traffic based on IP address and port number. However, they cannot perform URL-based redirection. This option would prevent HTTP access but not redirect it to HTTPS.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>B. Create a rule that replaces the HTTP in the URL with HTTPS</strong>:</p><ul><li>While this might work in theory, it is not a built-in feature of the ALB and would require custom implementation, such as modifying application code or using AWS Lambda@Edge. It is less straightforward compared to configuring a listener rule.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>D. Replace the ALB with a Network Load Balancer configured to use Server Name Indication (SNI)</strong>:</p><ul><li>A Network Load Balancer (NLB) operates at Layer 4 (transport layer) and does not support HTTP/HTTPS redirection natively. SNI is used for hosting multiple SSL certificates on a single NLB, which is unrelated to the task of redirecting HTTP to HTTPS.</li></ul></li></ul>',174)]))}]]),s=JSON.parse('{"path":"/posts/aws-saa/1.html","title":"AWS Solution Architect Associate Part 1:","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"icon":"pen-to-square","date":"2024-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","category":["Learning Records"],"tag":["AWS SAA"],"description":"AWS Solution Architect Associate Part 1: Question1 An application runs on an Amazon EC2 instance in a VPC.
