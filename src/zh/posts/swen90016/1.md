## Week 2: Processes and SDLCs

### Process:
A series of progressive and interdependent steps by which an end is attained.

#### Defined Process Control:
- Given the same inputs, a defined process should produce the same output every time (low volatility and easily predicted).

#### Empirical Process Control:
- Learn as we progress
- Expect and embrace change
- Inspect and adapt using short development cycles
- Estimates are indicative only and may not be accurate

### Activities in SDLC:
- Requirements Gathering
- Systems / Architectural Design
- Implementation / Coding / Integration
- Testing
- Evolution: Delivery and Release – Deployment, Maintenance

### SDLC Models:
- **Ad-hoc:** Code and fix.
- **Waterfall:** Document-driven. Not well-suited for situations where:
    - Errors are possible in requirement elicitation, analysis, and design
    - Requirements are hard to figure out or subject to change
- **Incremental:** Each “mini waterfall” phase produces deliverable increments of software.
    - **ADV:** Develop major requirements first; reduces risk of failure.
    - **DISADV:** Requires good planning and design.
- **Prototyping:** Build a prototype to refine requirements (may require multiple iterations, and can be expensive).
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Client-oriented, subset of product functionality.
- **Spiral:** Risk-driven, suitable for large, complex projects.
- **Agile 12 Principles:** Includes satisfying the customer, embracing changing requirements, and sustainable development.

### Scrum:
- **Pillars:** Transparency, Inspection, Adaptation
- **Roles:**
    - Scrum Master: Foster communication, protect team, agile coaching, remove blockers.
    - Product Owner: Define vision, manage product backlog, prioritize needs.

- **Business Risk:** Affects economic success (e.g., demand for product).

### Risk Identification Techniques:
- Pondering, Interviewing, Brainstorming, Checklists, Delphi Technique, SWOT Analysis

### Risk Analysis (Qualitative):
- Risk Exposure = P(risk probability) * I(estimated risk impact)

### Risk Response Strategies:
1. Accept or ignore
2. Avoid
3. Mitigate
4. Transfer

### Monitor and Control:
- Risk Audits, Risk Reviews, Risk Status Meetings

- **AC:** Specific for each feature.

### Agile Estimation Issues:
- **Analysis Paralysis:** Spending too much time on details.
- **Cavalier Approach:** Ignoring uncertainty and risk.

### Why Story Points:
1. Dates don’t account for non-project work.
2. Dates have emotional attachment.
3. Each team estimates work on a slightly different scale.
