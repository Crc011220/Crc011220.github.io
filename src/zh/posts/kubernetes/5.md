# Different Types Of Deployment

## Traditional Deployment
In the early days of the internet, applications were directly deployed on physical machines.

### Advantages:
- Simple
- Does not require the involvement of other technologies

### Disadvantages:
- No clear resource boundaries for the application
- Difficult to allocate computing resources efficiently
- Programs may interfere with each other easily

## Virtualized Deployment
Multiple virtual machines can run on a single physical machine, where each virtual machine is an isolated environment.

### Advantages:
- Programs' environments do not interfere with each other
- Provides a certain level of security

### Disadvantages:
- Additional operating systems increase resource consumption and waste

## Containerized Deployment
Similar to virtualization, but containers share the underlying operating system.

### Advantages:
- Ensures each container has its own file system, CPU, memory, process space, etc.
- Resources required by applications are packaged within the container, decoupled from the underlying infrastructure
- Containerized applications can be deployed across cloud providers and Linux distributions

### Challenges in Containerized Deployment:
Although containerized applications offer many benefits, they come with certain challenges, such as:

- When a container fails, how can another container immediately start to replace the failed one?
- How can container numbers be horizontally scaled when traffic increases?

These container management challenges are called **Container Orchestration Issues**. To address these problems, several container orchestration software tools have been developed:

- **Swarm**: Docker's own container orchestration tool
- **Mesos**: Apache's resource management tool, which needs to be combined with Marathon
- **Kubernetes**: A container orchestration tool open-sourced by Google
