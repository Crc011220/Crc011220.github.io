# KMP Algorithm

The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm is an efficient string matching algorithm that searches for occurrences of a pattern within a text. It improves upon the naive approach by avoiding unnecessary comparisons, using information gathered from previous comparisons to skip sections of the text.

## How it Works

The KMP algorithm preprocesses the pattern to create a longest prefix-suffix (LPS) array, which is used to determine how many characters can be skipped when a mismatch occurs. This allows the algorithm to achieve a time complexity of O(n + m), where n is the length of the text and m is the length of the pattern.

## Java Example

Here is a simple implementation of the KMP algorithm in Java:

```java
public class KMP {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String text = "ABABDABACDABABCABAB";
    String pattern = "ABABCABAB";
    int[] lps = new int[pattern.length()];
    computeLPSArray(pattern, lps);
    int index = KMPSearch(text, pattern, lps);
    System.out.println("Pattern found at index: " + index);
  }

  public static void computeLPSArray(String pattern, int[] lps) {
    int len = 0;
    lps[0] = 0;
    int i = 1;
    while (i < pattern.length()) {
      if (pattern.charAt(i) == pattern.charAt(len)) {
        len++;
        lps[i] = len;
        i++;
      }
    }
  }

  public static int KMPSearch(String text, String pattern, int[] lps) {
    int i = 0;
    int j = 0;
  }

}

```
