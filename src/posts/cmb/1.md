# Week 1

## Interface Development: Auto-Complete Project-Related System Configuration Information

#### Read the source code, understand the business logic
#### Develop the interface
#### Do unit test for the interface
#### Interface optimizations (For same data reduce run time from 2:30 to 1:30)
#### Add new logic for the interface
#### Configure APP and Email remind functionality

## Technical Points
- **DozerMapper Class**:
  - `map` method: Maps a source object to a destination object, commonly used for copying properties between objects.
  - Example:
    ```java
    DozerBeanMapper mapper = new DozerBeanMapper();
    DestinationObject destObject = mapper.map(sourceObject, DestinationObject.class);
    ```

- **Upsert Operations**:
  - Common operations for handling duplicate keys in different databases:
    - `INSERT ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` (MySQL):
      ```sql
      INSERT INTO table (id, column1, column2) VALUES (1, 'value1', 'value2')
      ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE column1 = VALUES(column1), column2 = VALUES(column2);
      ```

- **INSERT IGNORE**:
  - `INSERT IGNORE` is a feature in MySQL used to ignore the record if a conflict occurs, rather than throwing an error.
  - Example:
    ```sql
    INSERT IGNORE INTO table (id, column1, column2) VALUES (1, 'value1', 'value2');
    ```

- **Difference Between INSERT IGNORE and Upsert**:
  - `INSERT IGNORE`: Ignores conflicts and makes no changes to existing records.
  - Upsert: Updates existing records when conflicts occur.

- **Avoiding Null Pointer Exceptions**:
  - Instead of using `projectDTO.getProjectStatus().equals("XXX")`, which can throw a null pointer exception if `projectDTO.getProjectStatus()` returns null, it is better to check if `projectDTO.getProjectStatus()` is null first.
  - Example:
    ```java
    if ("XXX".equals(projectDTO.getProjectStatus())) {
        // Do something
    }
    ```

- **@ConfigurationProperties Annotation**:
  - Used to load configuration properties with a specific prefix from configuration files (e.g., YAML) into a Bean.
  - Example:
    ```yaml
    xxx:
      xxx:
        property1: value1
        property2: value2
    ```
    ```java
    @ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "xxx.xxx")
    public class ConfigProperties {
        private String property1;
        private String property2;

        // Getters and Setters
    }
    ```

## Interface Development: General Email Sending API
### Project Background
- The bank provides a "One-Stop Email" service, and ZA21 has already implemented a mail client. However, to reduce permission application processes and improve usability, there is a need to encapsulate these functionalities further into a general email sending interface, achieving MAILaaS (Mail as a Service).

### Key Requirements
1. **Support for Sending Both Plain Emails and Emails with Attachments**:
  - Parameters should be designed to match those of the ZA21 email message client.
2. **Deploy on FAAS(Function as a Service) Platform**:
  - The service will be deployed on the FAAS platform (China Merchant Bank's cloud platform) to ensure high availability and scalability.
3. **Technical Debt Rate**:
  - The technical debt rate must be less than 1.0%, emphasizing the importance of code quality and maintainability.
4. **Flexible Deployment Across Different Network Environments**:
  - The service should be deployable in different network environments, such as BIZ, DMZ, and office networks, based on actual needs.
