# Docker Volume

### The runtime environment of the container provider should be decoupled from the data generated by the program and the configurations the program depends on. A volume is a virtual directory that acts as a bridge between the container's internal directory and the host's directory.

## Data Mount Directory
```bash
/var/lib/docker/volumes/
docker run -d --name nginx -p 80:80 -v html:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx
-v html:/usr/share/nginx/html mounts the host's html directory to the container's /usr/share/nginx/html directory.
```

## Mount Local Directory
```bash
docker run -d --name nginx -p 80:80 -v /Users/crc/Documents/IT-Study/Project/my-docs/src/posts/docker/html:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx
```
### Mount local directory
-v local_directory:container_directory
### Mount local file
-v local_file:container_file
Note: The local directory or file must start with / or ./; if it starts directly with a name, it will be recognized as a volume name rather than a local directory name.

## Command
| Description              | Command                   |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Create a volume          | docker volume create   |
| List all volumes         | docker volume ls       |
| Remove a specific volume | docker volume rm       |
| Inspect a specific volume| docker volume inspect  |
| Remove all unused volumes| docker volume prune    |

## Notice!
The mounting of containers and data volumes must be configured when creating the container. For already created containers, data volumes cannot be set. Additionally, **during the container creation process, data volumes are automatically created and do not need to be manually created**.
