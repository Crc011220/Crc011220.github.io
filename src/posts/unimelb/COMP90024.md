# Cluster and Cloud Computing (COMP90024)

## Week 1

### Cloud Characteristics
– On-demand self-service . A consumer can provision computing
capabilities as needed without requiring human interaction with
each service provider.
– Networked access . Capabilities are available over the network and
accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by
heterogeneous client platforms.
- Resource pooling . The provider's computing resources are pooled to
serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model potentially
with different physical and virtual resources that can be
dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer
demand.
– Rapid elasticity . Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and
released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly upon
demand.
– Measured service . Cloud systems automatically control and
optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some
level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service.

### Grid Computing

## Week 2

### Horizontal and Vertical Scaling
- Horizontal scaling refers to adding more resources to a system, easy to add more, cost not so high.
- Vertical scaling refers to increasing the resources of a system, more complex, cost high.

### Approaches for Parallelism (where and how)
– Explicit (openMP / MPI) vs Implicit parallelism
– Hardware
– Operating System
– Software/Applications
– Some or all of these

:::info
Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a standardized and portable message-passing system designed to function on a wide range of parallel computers.
:::

### Erroneous Assumptions of Distributed Systems
1. The network is reliable
2. Latency is zero
3. Bandwidth is infinite
4. The network is secure
5. Topology doesn't change
6. There is one administrator
7. Transport cost is zero
8. The network is homogeneous
9. Time is ubiquitous

## Week 3
![HPC Cluster Design](HPC_Cluster_Design.png)

### Amdahl's Law and Gustafson's Law
#### 🌟 **Key Differences**
| Law | Assumption | Best Use Case | Result |
|------|------------|---------------|--------|
| **Amdahl's Law** | Fixed problem size | Small-scale problems, focus on bottlenecks | Speedup limited by the serial part |
| **Gustafson's Law** | Scalable problem size | Large-scale problems, focus on parallel efficiency | Speedup can scale nearly linearly with the number of processors |
 
 **If you can make use of parallelisation you should make use of it! It will always generate some benefit, and the larger the problem the bigger the gain.**

### Environment Modules
Environment Modules is a tool used to dynamically manage and configure the user’s shell environment in Unix-like systems. It is widely used in High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments to simplify the use of software packages and manage different software versions without conflicts.  

Modules work by modifying environment variables (e.g., `PATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `MANPATH`, etc.) when a module is loaded or unloaded. This allows users to switch between different versions of the same software easily without modifying the system configuration.

## Week 4
### Public Clouds
#### Pros
– Utility computing
– Can focus on core business
– Cost-effective
– “Right-sizing”
– Democratisation of computing
#### Cons
– Security
– Loss of control
– Possible lock-in
– Dependency of Cloud provider continued existence

### Private (on premise) Clouds
#### Pros
– Control
– Consolidation of resources
– Easier to secure
– More trust
#### Cons
– Relevance to core business? e.g., Netflix ->Amazon
– Staff/management overheads
– Hardware obsolescence
– Over/under utilisation challenges
– (Effort and cost of establishing a data centre)

### OpenStack
- Open Source: OpenStack is a completely open-source cloud computing platform, and anyone can download, install, and modify the source code. It allows enterprises to build and manage their own cloud infrastructure in private data centers with full control.
- Deployment: OpenStack is typically deployed on an organization's own hardware or can be deployed on any supported hardware (including virtual machines). Therefore, it is suitable for private cloud and hybrid cloud deployments.
- Highly Customizable: Being open-source, OpenStack allows users to highly customize according to their needs.
- Primarily provides Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) functionalities such as computing, storage, and networking.
- Offers services like Nova (compute), Swift (object storage), Neutron (networking), Cinder (block storage), Keystone (identity management), etc.
- Requires enterprises to manage and maintain their services themselves.
