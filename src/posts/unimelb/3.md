# Introduction to Machine Learning (COMP90049)

## Week 1

- Machine learning is a method of teaching software to learn from data and make decisions on their own, without being explicitly programmed.

### Three ingredients for machine learning
1. Data
• Discrete vs continuous vs ...
• Big data vs small data
• Labeled data vs unlabeled data
• Public vs sensitive data

2. Models
• function mapping from inputs to outputs
• probabilistic machine learning models
• geometric machine learning models
• parameters of the function are unknown

3. Learning
• Improving (on a task) after data is taken into account
• Finding the best model parameters (for a given task)
• Supervised vs. unsupervised learning

Supervised Learning:监督学习使用带有标签的数据进行训练，模型学习输入（features）到输出（labels）之间的映射关系。
Unsupervised Learning:无监督学习使用没有标签的数据，模型通过分析数据的模式和结构来进行学习。

### Linear Algebra Review
#### Matrices
- Matrices addition/subtraction: Add(Subtract) correspond ingentries in A and B 
- Matrix multiplication: Multiply corresponding entries in A and B and sum the products
![Matrix Multiplication](matrix-multiplication.png)
- Matrix transpose: Transpose of a matrix is obtained by interchanging its rows and columns. Matrix is **symmetric** if it is equal to its transpose.
- Matrix inverse: The inverse of a matrix A is denoted by A^-1 and is obtained by multiplying A by its inverse. 
- A matrix cannot be inverted if: More rows than columns, More columns than rows,Redundant rows/columns (linear independence)
#### Vectors
- A vector is a matrix with several rows and **one** column
- Vector addition/subtraction: Add(Subtract) corresponding entries in A and B
- Vector inner product: Multiply corresponding entries in A and B and sum the products
- Vector Euclidean norm: The square root of the sum of the squares of the entries in the vector.

- Vector inner product: The dot product of two vectors A and B is the sum of the products of their corresponding entries.
- The cosine of the angle between two vectors can be found by using norms and the inner product

### Instances, Attributes, and Learning Paradigms (Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning)
- In ML terminology examples are called Instances
- Each instance can have some Features or Attributes
- Concepts are things that we aim to learn. Generally, in the form of labels or classes

#### Unsupervised do not have access to an inventory of classes and instead discover groups of ‘similar’ examples in a given dataset.
- Clustering is unsupervised — the learner operates without a set of labelled training data
- **Success is often measured subjectively; evaluation is problematic**

#### Supervised methods have prior knowledge of classes and set out to discover and categorise new instances according to those classes
- Classification learning is supervised
• In Classification, we can exhaustively list/enumerate all possible labels for a given instance; a correct prediction
entails mapping an instance to the label which is truly correct
- Regression learning is supervised 
• In Regression,"infinitely" many labels are possible, we cannot conceivably enumerate them; a “correct” prediction is when the numeric value is acceptably close to the true value

### Featured Data Types
1. Discrete: Nominal (Categorical)
- Values are distinct symbols, values themselves serve only as labels or names
- No relation is implied among nominal values (no ordering or distance measure)
- Only equality tests can be performed
- e.g. Student Number
2. Ordinal
- An explicit order is imposed on the values
- Addition and subtraction does not make sense
- e.g. Educational Level
3. Continuous: Numeric
- Numeric quantities are real-valued attributes
- All mathematical operations are allowed 

## Equal Width vs. Equal Frequency vs. Clustering

| Method                  | Equal Width Binning          | Equal Frequency Binning       | Clustering                   |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Definition**          | Each bin has the same width | Each bin contains the same number of data points | Groups data points based on similarity |
| **Type**               | Data discretization        | Data discretization         | Unsupervised learning       |
| **Advantages**         | Easy to compute, simple     | Suitable for skewed distributions | Can detect natural groupings in data |
| **Disadvantages**       | Sparse or dense bins if data density varies | Uneven bin width, harder to interpret | May require tuning (e.g., number of clusters) |
| **Common Algorithms**   | Fixed width intervals      | Quantiles-based binning     | K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering |
| **Use Cases**          | Histogram creation, feature engineering | Handling skewed data in ML models | Customer segmentation, anomaly detection |

Equal Width Binning：用于简单离散化，每个 bin 宽度相同，但可能会导致数据密度不均衡。
Equal Frequency Binning：每个 bin 的数据量相等，适合处理偏态数据，但 bin 的宽度不一致，可能难以解释。
Clustering（聚类）：用于无监督学习，根据数据点的相似性自动分组，适合发现隐藏模式，但通常需要调整参数（如 k 值）。

## Standardization vs. Normalization

| **Method**              | **Standardization (Z-score)**            | **Min-Max Normalization**         |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Formula**            | \( X' = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} \)       | \( X' = \frac{X - X_{\min}}{X_{\max} - X_{\min}} \) |
| **Range**              | Mean = 0, Std = 1                        | [0,1] or [-1,1]                 |
| **Best for**           | Normally distributed data                | Data with fixed bounds          |
| **Sensitive to outliers?** | Less sensitive                          | More sensitive                   |
| **Formula** | (X - mean) / std | (X - min) / (max - min) |
:::info
Standardization：将数据标准化到均值为 0，标准差为 1 的分布，适用于正态分布的数据。
Normalization：将数据缩放到 [0,1] 或 [-1,1] 范围内，适用于数据范围固定的数据。
