# Cluster and Cloud Computing (COMP90024)

## Week 1

### Cloud Characteristics
– On-demand self-service . A consumer can provision computing
capabilities as needed without requiring human interaction with
each service provider.
– Networked access . Capabilities are available over the network and
accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by
heterogeneous client platforms.
- Resource pooling . The provider's computing resources are pooled to
serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model potentially
with different physical and virtual resources that can be
dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer
demand.
– Rapid elasticity . Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and
released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly upon
demand.
– Measured service . Cloud systems automatically control and
optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some
level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service.
