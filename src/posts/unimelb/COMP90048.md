# Declarative Programming (COMP90048)

## Week 1

#### Imperative languages are based on commands, in the form of instructions and statements.
- Commands are executed.
- Commands have an effect, such as to update the computation state,and later code may depend on this update.
#### Logic programming languages are based on finding values that satisfy a set of constraints.
- Constraints may have multiple solutions or none at all.
- Constraints do not have an effect.
#### Functional languages are based on evaluating expressions.
- Expressions are evaluated.
- Expressions do not have an effect.

## Prolog
Prolog is a declarative programming language. It is based on logic programming and uses the predicate calculus.

```prolog
% import the test.pl file
% (A small part of) the British Royal family
% parent(queen_elizabeth, prince_charles).
% parent(prince_philip, prince_charles).
% parent(prince_charles, prince_william).
% parent(prince_charles, prince_harry).
% parent(princess_diana, prince_william).
% parent(princess_diana, prince_harry).
?- [test].
%queries
?- parent(prince_charles, prince_william).
% true
% This query asks: of whom Prince Charles is a parent?
?- parent(prince_charles, X)
```

- If there is more than one answer to the query, Prolog prints them one at a time, pausing to see if more solutions are wanted. Typing semicolon asks for more solutions; just hitting enter (return) finishes without more solutions.

### Rules
**Rules need to be written in the file .pl**
```prolog
% “X is grandparent of Z if X is parent of Y and Y is parent of Z .”
grandparent(X,Z) :- parent(X, Y), parent(Y, Z).
```
- Rules can be recursive. Prolog has no looping constructs, so recursion is widely used.
```prolog
% A person’s ancestors are their parents and the ancestors of their parents.
ancestor(Anc, Desc) :-parent(Parent, Desc),ancestor(Anc, Parent).
```

### Equality
- Equality in Prolog, written “=” and used as an infix operator, can be used both to bind variables and to check for equality. Prolog is a single-assignment language: once bound, a variable cannot be reassigned.

### Disjunction and Conjunction
- Goals can be combined with disjunction (or) as well as conjunction (and). Disjunction is written “;” and used as an infix operator. Conjunction (“,”) has higher precedence (binds tighter) than disjunction, but parentheses can be used to achieve the desired precedence.

### Negation
- Negation in Prolog is written “\+” and used as a prefix operator. Negation has higher (tighter) precedence than both conjunction and disjunction. Be sure to leave a space between the \+ and an open parenthesis.
```prolog
% Who are the parents of Prince William other than Prince Charles?
?- parent(X, prince_william), \+ X = prince_charles.
X = princess_diana.
```
- Disequality in Prolog is written as an infix “\=”. So X \= Y is the same as \+ X = Y.

### Closed World Assumption
- Prolog assumes that all terms are true, unless explicitly stated otherwise. This is called the closed world assumption (CWA). **This means that if a term is not mentioned in the program, it is assumed to be false**. This can be a problem if the program is used to reason about real-world situations, where some terms may be unknown or undecidable.

:::info
1. Variables must start with an uppercase letter (A-Z) or _.
2. Atoms (constants) must start with a lowercase letter (a-z) or be enclosed in single quotes ('...').
3. Prolog is strictly case-sensitive, so X and x are completely different!

## Week 2
### Prolog Concepts
- In Prolog, all data structures are called term. A term can be atomic orcompound, or it can be a variable.
- An atom begins with a lower case letter and follows with letters, digits and underscores
- each compound term is a functor (sometimes called function symbol) followed by one or more arguments in parentheses, separated by commas.
- List: [] is the empty list, [H | T] is a list with head H and tail T.
- A variable is also a term. It denotes a single unknown term. A variable name begins with an upper case letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, digits, and underscores.
- Prolog is a single-assignment language: a variable can only be bound (assigned) once.
- A term is a ground term if it contains no variables, and it is a nonground term if it contains at least one variable.
- A substitution is a mapping from variables to terms.Any ground Prolog term has only one instance, while a nonground Prolog terms has an infinite number of instances.

### Proper Lists
- A proper list is either empty ([]) or not ([X | Y]), in which case, the tail of the list must be a proper list. We can define a predicate to recognise these.
```prolog
proper_list([]).
proper_list([_Head|Tail]) :-
proper_list(Tail).
```

### Append
- The append operation is used to concatenate two lists. It is defined as follows:
```prolog
append([], C, C).
append([A|B], C, [A|BC]) :-
append(B, C, BC).
```

### e.g. Find the first n th elements of a list
```prolog
% Find the first n th elements of a list
take(N, List, Front) :-
length(Front,N),
append(Front, _, List).
```

### Arithmetic
- Use the built-in predicate is/2 (an infix operator) evaluates expressions.

### Logic and Resolution

#### 1. **Resolution Method (Resolution)**:
Resolution is an inference method used in automated reasoning systems (like Prolog). It works by applying facts and rules to a goal, simplifying the goal until it becomes either a tautology or a contradiction.

#### 2. **Rules and Facts**:
- **Facts** are known true statements.
- **Rules** are conditional inferences and are written in the form of `head :- body`. This means if `body` is true, then `head` is true.

#### 3. **Resolution Algorithm**:
- The core of the resolution method is to use **proof by contradiction** (driving reasoning through negation of the goal).
- It simplifies the goal by matching it with rules and facts in the program until a conclusion is reached, or no solution is found.

#### 4. **Specific Process**:
- Select a clause and attempt to match it with the goal.
- Use logical reasoning to reduce the goal until it is either true (tautology) or false (contradiction). If the goal is true, a solution has been found. If false, there is no solution.

#### Summary:
Resolution in Prolog is used to derive a goal step by step by applying rules, rather than directly "computing" the result. It is a **logic programming** approach based on inference.


## Week 3

### Debugger

- The debugger prints the current port, execution depth, and goal (with the current variable bindings) at each step.
- use `trace.` to start tracing, and `notrace.` to stop tracing. `creep` can be used to step through the program one step at a time.
- Bird box model: the debugger shows the current state of the program, and the user can selectively step through the program to examine the intermediate states.

### Infinite backtracking loop
- If a goal cannot be proven, Prolog will backtrack and try other possibilities. This can lead to an infinite loop.
- To avoid this, we can use the `once` predicate, which will try to prove the goal once, and fail if it cannot be proven。


### Tail Recursion
- Tail recursion is a special case of recursion where the recursive call is the last operation performed in the function.
- Efficiency: Tail recursion helps to avoid adding stack frames with each recursive call, thereby reducing memory consumption. Especially with deep recursion, it can prevent stack overflow errors.
- Optimization: Some Prolog implementations can optimize tail-recursive predicates by reusing the same stack frame, making the performance of tail recursion as efficient as iterative solutions.

- We make factorial tail recursive by introducing an accumulating parameter, or just an accumulator. This is an extra parameter to the predicate that holds a partially computed result.
