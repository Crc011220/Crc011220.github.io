# Practice
Starting from Elasticsearch 8.x, security authentication is enabled by default, and curl cannot be used to access it directly. You need to use a username and password for authentication.
To disable security authentication:
``` bash
sudo vi /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
xpack.security.enabled: false
sudo systemctl restart elasticsearch
```
