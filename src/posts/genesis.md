# Genesis

Welcome to my blog! This is where my journey to start recording the world of programming begins :tada:

### What to Expect

- **Learning Records :spiral_notepad:**: Notes and insights from my coursework.
- **Project Showcases :computer:**: Detailed looks at my personal projects and their development processes.
