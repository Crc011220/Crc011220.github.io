# MyBatis: Difference between `#` and `*`

In MyBatis, both `#` and `*` are used in SQL queries, but they serve different purposes:

### `#` - Parameter Placeholder
The `#` symbol is used to represent **parameter placeholders** in SQL queries. It is used for **parameter substitution** and ensures that user input is safely injected into the query to avoid SQL injection. MyBatis automatically escapes special characters in parameters when `#` is used.

#### Example:
```xml
<select id="findUserById" parameterType="int" resultType="User">
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = #{userId}
</select>
```
In this example, `#{userId}` will be replaced with the value of `userId` from the Java code, and MyBatis will handle any necessary escaping.

### `*` - Wildcard (for result mapping)
The `*` symbol in MyBatis is typically used in a **result map** or **select clause** to indicate selecting all columns or when dynamically mapping results to properties. It doesn't have a special function within MyBatis itself, but it is often used in SQL statements as part of selecting all columns in a table.

#### Example:
```xml
<select id="selectAllUsers" resultType="User">
  SELECT * FROM users
</select>
```
In this query, * selects all columns from the users table.

### Summary of Differences:
#### #: Used for safely injecting parameters in SQL queries (parameter substitution).
#### *: Used in SQL to select all columns (wildcard) or as part of result mapping.
