# Differences between @Autowired and @Resource

### In Spring Framework, `@Autowired` and `@Resource` are both annotations used for dependency injection, but they have some key differences in terms of usage and behavior. 

### Injection by Type vs. Name
- **@Autowired**: Injects by type.
- **@Resource**: Injects by name (with fallback to type).

### Required Behavior
- **@Autowired**: Required by default.
- **@Resource**: Not required by default.

### Usage Context
- **@Autowired**: More flexible for various injection points.
- **@Resource**: Primarily used for field injection.

### Package
- **@Autowired**: Specific to Spring.
- **@Resource**: Part of the Java EE specification.
