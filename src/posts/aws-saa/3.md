![IAM Summary](IAM-Summary.png)

## EC2
EC2 is the AWS Elastic Compute Cloud service that provides resizable compute capacity in the AWS cloud. It enables you to launch virtual machines (VMs) in the AWS cloud, and configure them with the software you need to run your applications.
[EC2 Instance Types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)
[See al list of EC2 instances and comparisons](https://instances.vantage.sh/)

**Use IAM role for EC2 instances, and do not enter any credentials in the instance.**

![CNAME and Alias](CNAME-and-Alias.png)

### Routing Policies
| Routing Policy          | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| **Simple Routing**      | Default routing, maps a domain to a single endpoint. |
| **Weighted Routing**    | Distributes traffic across multiple resources based on assigned weights. |
| **Latency-Based Routing** | Routes users to the region with the lowest latency. |
| **Geolocation Routing** | Directs traffic based on the user's geographic location. |
| **Geoproximity Routing** | Routes users to the nearest AWS region/resource with bias control. |
| **Failover Routing**    | Redirects traffic to a backup resource if the primary fails. |
| **Multi-Value Answer**  | Returns multiple IP addresses to distribute load among resources. |

## Beanstalk
- Simplified deployment and management of web applications on AWS.
- Supports multiple programming languages and frameworks (e.g., Ruby on Rails, Node.js, Java, Python, Go).
- Supports auto-scaling, load balancing, and health monitoring.

## S3
- Objects (files) have a key, and key is the full path to the object in the bucket.

### S3 Versioning
- S3 Versioning allows you to keep multiple versions of an object in the same bucket. 

### Amazon S3 Encryption 
#### Methods Comparison

| Encryption Method  | Description | Key Management | Use Case | AWS CLI Example |
|--------------------|-------------|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| **SSE-S3** (Server-Side Encryption with S3 Managed Keys) | AWS S3 **automatically encrypts** objects with **AES-256** and manages the keys. | Managed by AWS (no user control) | Default encryption, no extra setup needed. | `aws s3 cp myfile.txt s3://mybucket/ --sse AES256` |
| **SSE-KMS** (Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMS Keys) | Uses **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)** for key storage and access control. Supports **audit logging**. | Managed in **AWS KMS**, fine-grained control | Compliance-heavy workloads needing **audit logs & access control** | `aws s3 cp myfile.txt s3://mybucket/ --sse aws:kms` |
| **SSE-C** (Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys) | You provide the encryption key. AWS **does not store** the key. | Fully managed by the user | Full control over encryption keys (but must securely store them) | `aws s3 cp myfile.txt s3://mybucket/ --sse-c AES256 --sse-c-key "your-base64-key"` |
| **Client-Side Encryption** | Data is encrypted **before uploading to S3** using an SDK or external tools. | Fully managed by the user | When you **don‚Äôt trust AWS** to manage encryption keys. Used for **extra security layers**. | Use AWS SDK or OpenSSL: `openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in myfile.txt -out myfile.enc` |

#### S3 Encryption in Transit

| Protection Type | Description | Implementation |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|
| **HTTPS/TLS** | Encrypts data **during transmission** to/from S3. | Use `https://` for S3 API calls |
| **VPC Endpoints** | Keeps S3 traffic **inside AWS private network** instead of the public internet. | Configure **VPC endpoint** for S3 |

### S3 Bucket Policies
- Bucket policies are JSON documents that specify who can access the bucket and what actions they can perform.

### S3 CORS
- If a client does a cross-origin request on S3, we need to enable the correct CORS headers.
- Different buckets are in different origins, so we need to enable CORS for each bucket separately.
