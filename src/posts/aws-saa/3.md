## IAM
IAM is the AWS Identity and Access Management service that enables you to manage users, groups, and roles in your AWS account. It is a centralized control point that manages access to your AWS resources.
![IAM Guidelines](IAM.png)
![IAM Summary](IAM-Summary.png)

## EC2
EC2 is the AWS Elastic Compute Cloud service that provides resizable compute capacity in the AWS cloud. It enables you to launch virtual machines (VMs) in the AWS cloud, and configure them with the software you need to run your applications.
[EC2 Instance Types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)
[See al list of EC2 instances and comparisons](https://instances.vantage.sh/)

**Use IAM role for EC2 instances, and do not enter any credentials in the instance.**

### Amazon S3 Encryption 
#### Methods Comparison

| Encryption Method  | Description | Key Management | Use Case | AWS CLI Example |
|--------------------|-------------|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| **SSE-S3** (Server-Side Encryption with S3 Managed Keys) | AWS S3 **automatically encrypts** objects with **AES-256** and manages the keys. | Managed by AWS (no user control) | Default encryption, no extra setup needed. | `aws s3 cp myfile.txt s3://mybucket/ --sse AES256` |
| **SSE-KMS** (Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMS Keys) | Uses **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)** for key storage and access control. Supports **audit logging**. | Managed in **AWS KMS**, fine-grained control | Compliance-heavy workloads needing **audit logs & access control** | `aws s3 cp myfile.txt s3://mybucket/ --sse aws:kms` |
| **SSE-C** (Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys) | You provide the encryption key. AWS **does not store** the key. | Fully managed by the user | Full control over encryption keys (but must securely store them) | `aws s3 cp myfile.txt s3://mybucket/ --sse-c AES256 --sse-c-key "your-base64-key"` |
| **Client-Side Encryption** | Data is encrypted **before uploading to S3** using an SDK or external tools. | Fully managed by the user | When you **don‚Äôt trust AWS** to manage encryption keys. Used for **extra security layers**. | Use AWS SDK or OpenSSL: `openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in myfile.txt -out myfile.enc` |

#### S3 Encryption in Transit

| Protection Type | Description | Implementation |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|
| **HTTPS/TLS** | Encrypts data **during transmission** to/from S3. | Use `https://` for S3 API calls |
| **VPC Endpoints** | Keeps S3 traffic **inside AWS private network** instead of the public internet. | Configure **VPC endpoint** for S3 |

### S3 Bucket Policies
- Bucket policies are JSON documents that specify who can access the bucket and what actions they can perform.

### S3 CORS
- If a client does a cross-origin request on S3, we need to enable the correct CORS headers.
- Different buckets are in different origins, so we need to enable CORS for each bucket separately.

 ### S3 Access Logs
 - S3 Access Logs are files that contain detailed records of all requests made to S3 buckets.
- They can be used to analyze access patterns, identify security threats, and troubleshoot issues.

### S3 Replication 
- CRR (Cross-Region Replication) is a type of replication that enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across buckets in different AWS regions.
- SRR (Same-Region Replication) is a type of replication that enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects within the same AWS region.
![S3-Replication] (S3-Replication.png)

### S3 Pre-Signed URLs
- Pre-signed URLs allow you to grant time-limited access to S3 objects without requiring users to have access to the AWS account.
- They can be used to provide temporary access to specific objects, such as for file downloads or uploads.
- Pre-signed URLs can be generated using the AWS SDK or the AWS CLI.

### S3 Storage Classes

| Storage Class | Use Case | Access Frequency | Storage Cost | Request Cost | Availability | Durability | Retrieval Time |

### S3 Lifecycle Rules
- S3 Lifecycle Rules can be used to automate the transition of objects between storage classes.

### S3 Event Notifications
- S3 Event Notifications can be used to trigger Lambda functions or other AWS services when certain events occur in S3.

### S3 Requester Pays
- S3 Requester Pays is a feature that allows you to charge the requester instead of the bucket owner for S3 operations.
- It can be used to reduce costs for cases where the requester is not the bucket owner, such as when downloading objects from S3.

## SQS  

### Message Visibility Timeout
- The visibility timeout is the amount of time that the message is invisible to other consumers after a reader has received and processed it. Default is 30 seconds.
- If a message is not deleted from the queue after it has been received and processed, it will become visible to other consumers again after the visibility timeout expires.
