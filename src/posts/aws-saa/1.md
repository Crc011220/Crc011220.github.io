# AWS Solution Architect Associate 
## Error review notes

1. A company needs the ability to analyze the log files of its proprietary application. The logs are stored in JSON format in an Amazon S3 bucket. Queries will be simple and will run on-demand. A solutions architect needs to perform the analysis with minimal changes to the existing architecture.
What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead?

A. Use Amazon Redshift to load all the content into one place and run the SQL queries as needed.
B. Use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to store the logs. Run SQL queries as needed from the Amazon CloudWatch console.
**C. Use Amazon Athena directly with Amazon S3 to run the queries as needed. Most Voted**
D. Use AWS Glue to catalog the logs. Use a transient Apache Spark cluster on Amazon EMR to run the SQL queries as needed.

::: info
Option A (Amazon Redshift): While Redshift is suitable for data warehousing, it requires setting up and managing a data warehouse, which is more complex and introduces additional operational overhead.
Option B (Amazon CloudWatch Logs): CloudWatch Logs does not support direct SQL querying capabilities and is better suited for monitoring, not for data analytics over large volumes of data.
Option C (Amazon Athena): Athena provides a cost-effective, serverless way to query S3 data using SQL without additional management or setup, making it ideal for on-demand querying of JSON log files in S3.
Option D (AWS Glue with Amazon EMR): AWS Glue can catalog data, but using Amazon EMR with Spark clusters for transient jobs adds complexity and operational overhead compared to the serverless nature of Athena.
