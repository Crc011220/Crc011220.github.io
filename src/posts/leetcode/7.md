# Problem: Delete the Nth Node from the End of the Linked List

Given the head of a linked list, remove the Nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

## Approach: Two-Pointer Technique

1. **Initialize two pointers**, `first` and `second`, both pointing to the head of the list.
2. **Advance `first` pointer** by N nodes. This creates a gap of N nodes between `first` and `second`.
3. **Move both pointers** until `first` reaches the end. Now, `second` will be pointing to the node just before the Nth node from the end.
4. **Remove the target node** by updating the `next` pointer of `second`.
5. **Return the head** of the modified list.

This approach allows us to make a single pass through the list.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \( O(L) \), where \( L \) is the length of the list.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \), as we only use a constant amount of extra space.

## Java Code Implementation

```java
public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
    ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
    dummy.next = head;
    ListNode first = dummy;
    ListNode second = dummy;

    // Move first N+1 steps ahead
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        first = first.next;
    }

    // Move both pointers until first reaches the end
    while (first != null) {
        first = first.next;
        second = second.next;
    }

    // Skip the target node
    second.next = second.next.next;

    return dummy.next;
}
```
