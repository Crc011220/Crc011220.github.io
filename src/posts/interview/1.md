# MySQL

### 1. How to Identify Slow Queries in MySQL
Answer:  
During our stress testing, we noticed that some API responses were very slow, exceeding 2 seconds. Since our system integrates with SkyWalking/Prometheus for monitoring, its reports helped identify slow APIs and pinpoint which part of the API (including SQL execution) was slow.

If such monitoring systems are unavailable, MySQL itself provides a **slow query log** feature. You can enable it in the MySQL configuration file and set a threshold (e.g., 2 seconds). Queries exceeding this time will be logged, making it easier to identify slow queries.

---

### 2. How to Analyze Slow Queries
Answer:  
If a query is slow, we use the **EXPLAIN** command to analyze its execution plan. Key metrics include:
- **Key and key_len**: Check if the query uses indexes and whether they are effective.
- **Type**: Review the scan type (e.g., full table scan or range scan).
- **Extra**: Look for optimizations (e.g., avoid table backtracking or unnecessary sorting).

For example, if backtracking occurs, we might add indexes or optimize the returned fields to improve performance.

---

### 3. What Is an Index?
Answer:  
Indexes are data structures that help MySQL retrieve data efficiently. They reduce I/O costs, enable faster lookups, and can also help sort data, reducing CPU usage.

---

### 4. Underlying Data Structure of Indexes
Answer:  
The InnoDB engine uses **B+ trees** for index storage.  
Advantages of B+ trees:
- More child nodes per node, reducing tree depth.
- Lower disk I/O since non-leaf nodes store only keys and pointers.
- Suited for range queries because leaf nodes form a doubly linked list.

---

### 5. Differences Between B-Trees and B+ Trees
Answer:
1. **Data storage**:
    - B-Trees store data in both internal and leaf nodes.
    - B+ Trees store all data in leaf nodes, ensuring more consistent query performance.
2. **Range queries**:
    - B+ Trees excel in range queries as leaf nodes form a linked list.

---

### 6. Clustered vs. Non-Clustered Indexes
Answer:
- **Clustered Index**:  
  Data and index are stored together. In B+ trees, leaf nodes store entire rows. Each table usually has one clustered index, typically the primary key.
- **Non-Clustered Index**:  
  Data and index are stored separately. Leaf nodes store primary key values instead of full rows. Tables can have multiple non-clustered indexes.

---

### 7. What Is Backtracking in Queries?
Answer:  
Backtracking occurs when a secondary index points to the primary key, requiring an additional lookup in the clustered index to retrieve full row data.

---

### 8. What Is a Covering Index?
Answer:  
A **covering index** is one where all the fields required for a query are included in the index. This avoids backtracking and improves query performance.

---

### 9. How to Handle Large Pagination?
Answer:  
For large datasets, using `LIMIT` with sorting can be slow. Optimize with:
1. **Covering indexes**: Use indexed columns for pagination queries.
2. **Subqueries**: First fetch primary key IDs for the required page, then query using these IDs.

---

### 10. Principles for Index Creation
Answer:
- Create indexes for tables with over 100,000 rows.
- Index frequently queried columns (e.g., filters, sorting, grouping).
- Prefer composite indexes that cover query results.
- For fields with low cardinality, place them later in composite indexes.
- Use prefix indexes for long fields.
- Limit the number of indexes to balance read/write performance.

---

### 11. When Do Indexes Fail?
Answer:  
Indexes fail in cases such as:
- Ignoring the **leftmost prefix** principle in composite indexes.
- Using wildcard queries starting with `%`.
- Performing operations or type conversions on indexed fields.
- Using a range query in a composite index, making subsequent conditions ineffective.

---

### 12. SQL Optimization Techniques
Answer:  
Optimize SQL by:
- Selecting specific fields instead of `SELECT *`.
- Using `UNION ALL` instead of `UNION`.
- Using `INNER JOIN` for table joins and ensuring smaller tables are driving tables when using `LEFT JOIN` or `RIGHT JOIN`.
- Leveraging read-write separation and replication for large datasets.
- Sharding large tables across databases.

---

### 13. Table Creation Optimization
Answer:  
We followed the **Alibaba Development Handbook** to choose appropriate field types. For instance:
- Use `TINYINT`, `INT`, or `BIGINT` for numeric fields.
- Use `CHAR`, `VARCHAR`, or `TEXT` for strings based on size and variability.

---

### 14. Index Usage Optimization
Answer:  
We follow best practices for index creation, ensuring frequent query columns are indexed, avoiding operations on indexed fields, and controlling the total number of indexes.

---

### 15. Personal SQL Optimization Practices
Answer:
- Avoid `SELECT *`; specify required columns.
- Prevent index failure by writing query-friendly syntax.
- Prefer `UNION ALL` over `UNION`.
- Use `INNER JOIN` for better performance in joins.

---

### 16. What Are Transaction Properties?
Answer:  
Transactions follow **ACID** principles:
- **Atomicity**: All operations succeed or fail as a whole.
- **Consistency**: Data remains consistent across transactions.
- **Isolation**: Concurrent transactions don't interfere.
- **Durability**: Changes persist after commit.

---

### 17. Issues with Concurrent Transactions
Answer:  
Concurrency can lead to:
- **Dirty reads**: Reading uncommitted changes.
- **Non-repeatable reads**: Different values for the same query in one transaction.
- **Phantom reads**: Rows appearing or disappearing during a transaction.

---

### 18. Solving Concurrency Issues
Answer:  
MySQL uses isolation levels:
1. **READ UNCOMMITTED**: Allows all issues.
2. **READ COMMITTED**: Solves dirty reads.
3. **REPEATABLE READ**: Solves dirty and non-repeatable reads (default in MySQL).
4. **SERIALIZABLE**: Prevents all issues but reduces performance.

---

### 19. Difference Between Undo Log and Redo Log
Answer:
- **Redo Log**: Tracks physical changes for recovery after a crash, ensuring durability.
- **Undo Log**: Tracks logical changes for rollbacks, ensuring atomicity.

---

### 20. Ensuring Isolation with MVCC
Answer:  
**MVCC** uses hidden fields (`trx_id`, `roll_pointer`), **undo logs**, and a **read view** for consistent snapshots.

---

### 21. MySQL Master-Slave Synchronization
Answer:  
Master-slave replication works as follows:
1. Master records changes in a binary log (Binlog).
2. Slave reads the Binlog and writes changes to its relay log.
3. Slave replays the relay log to sync data.

---

### 22. Vertical vs. Horizontal Partitioning
Answer:
- **Vertical Partitioning**: Splitting databases by functionality (microservices architecture).
- **Horizontal Partitioning**: Splitting large tables across databases (e.g., sharding by ID).
