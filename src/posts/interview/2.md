## 1. Are singleton beans in the Spring framework thread-safe?
**Answer:**  
No, they are not thread-safe. When multiple users request a service simultaneously, the container allocates a thread for each request, and these threads concurrently execute business logic. If the logic modifies the singleton's state (e.g., updating a singleton's member property), thread synchronization must be handled explicitly.

Spring itself does not provide thread-safety mechanisms for singleton beans. Developers need to address thread safety and concurrency issues themselves. Typically, beans used in projects (like `Service` and `DAO` classes) are stateless, which makes singleton beans relatively thread-safe. For stateful beans (e.g., `ViewModel` objects), developers must ensure thread safety explicitly.

One simple solution is to change the bean's scope from `singleton` to `prototype`.

## 2. What is AOP?
**Answer:**  
AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) is used in Spring to extract common behaviors and logic that are not directly related to business concerns but affect multiple objects. This promotes reuse of common modules and reduces coupling. Common use cases include logging and transaction management.

## 3. Have you used AOP in your project?
**Answer:**  
Yes, we used AOP to record system operation logs in a backend management system. The approach involved using AOP's `@Around` advice and pointcut expressions to identify the methods where logs were needed. In the `@Around` advice, we extracted parameters such as class and method information, annotations, and request types. These parameters were then saved to the database as operation logs.

## 4. How are transactions implemented in Spring?
**Answer:**  
Spring transactions are implemented using AOP. It intercepts methods annotated with `@Transactional`, starting a transaction before the method execution and committing or rolling back the transaction based on the outcome of the method.

## 5. What scenarios can cause transaction failure in Spring?
**Answer:**  
Here are a few scenarios that can cause transaction failures:
1. If an exception is caught and handled internally without being re-thrown, the transaction will not roll back.
2. If a checked exception is thrown but `rollbackFor` is not explicitly set to `Exception` in the `@Transactional` annotation, the transaction may not roll back.
3. If the method annotated with `@Transactional` is not `public`, the transaction may not work as expected.

## 6. What is the lifecycle of a Spring bean?
**Answer:**  
The lifecycle of a Spring bean includes:
1. Retrieving bean definitions from `BeanDefinition`.
2. Instantiating the bean using its constructor.
3. Performing dependency injection via setter methods or `@Autowired`.
4. Handling beans that implement the `Aware` interface.
5. Executing `BeanPostProcessor`'s pre-processing.
6. Initializing the bean (via `InitializingBean` or custom `init-method`).
7. Executing `BeanPostProcessor`'s post-processing (proxy creation may occur here).
8. Destroying the bean during container shutdown.

## 7. What is circular dependency in Spring?
**Answer:**  
Circular dependency occurs when two or more beans depend on each other, forming a closed loop. Spring resolves most circular dependencies using a **three-level cache**:
1. **Level 1 Cache:** The singleton pool, storing fully initialized beans.
2. **Level 2 Cache:** A cache for early references of beans (partially initialized).
3. **Level 3 Cache:** A cache for `ObjectFactory` instances to create bean proxies.

## 8. How does Spring resolve circular dependencies?
**Answer:**  
The resolution process is as follows:
1. Instantiate Bean A and store its `ObjectFactory` in the level 3 cache.
2. During Bean A's initialization, it requires Bean B, triggering Bean B's creation process.
3. Instantiate Bean B and store its `ObjectFactory` in the level 3 cache.
4. Bean B requires Bean A, so it retrieves Bean A from the level 3 cache, initializes it partially, and moves it to the level 2 cache.
5. Bean B is completed and stored in the level 1 cache.
6. Bean A finishes its initialization by injecting Bean B and is then moved to the level 1 cache.

## 9. How to resolve circular dependencies caused by constructors?
**Answer:**  
Circular dependencies involving constructors cannot be resolved by Spring because the constructor phase is the first step in bean creation. To resolve this, you can use the `@Lazy` annotation to delay the creation of one of the beans until it is needed.

## 10. What is the Spring MVC execution flow?
**Answer:**  
The Spring MVC execution flow is as follows:
1. The user sends a request to the front controller (`DispatcherServlet`).
2. The `DispatcherServlet` consults `HandlerMapping` to find the appropriate handler.
3. `HandlerMapping` returns the handler and any interceptors to the `DispatcherServlet`.
4. The `DispatcherServlet` calls `HandlerAdapter`.
5. `HandlerAdapter` invokes the specific controller method.
6. The controller executes and returns a `ModelAndView` object.
7. The `HandlerAdapter` passes the `ModelAndView` back to the `DispatcherServlet`.
8. The `DispatcherServlet` resolves the view using `ViewResolver`.
9. The resolved view is rendered by the `DispatcherServlet`.
10. The response is sent back to the user.

## 11. What is the principle of Spring Boot's auto-configuration?
**Answer:**  
Spring Boot's auto-configuration is based on the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation, which combines:
- `@SpringBootConfiguration`
- `@EnableAutoConfiguration`
- `@ComponentScan`

The core annotation, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, uses `@Import` to load configuration classes. These classes are defined in `META-INF/spring.factories` and are conditionally loaded based on the environment.

## 12. What are common annotations in Spring?
**Answer:**  
Common Spring annotations include:
1. **Bean Declaration Annotations:**
    - `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Controller`.
2. **Dependency Injection Annotations:**
    - `@Autowired`, `@Qualifier`, `@Resource`.
3. **Scope Configuration Annotation:**
    - `@Scope`.
4. **Configuration Annotations:**
    - `@Configuration`, `@ComponentScan`, `@Bean`.
5. **AOP Annotations:**
    - `@Aspect`, `@Before`, `@After`, `@Around`, `@Pointcut`.

## 13. What are common annotations in Spring MVC?
**Answer:**  
Common Spring MVC annotations include:
- `@RequestMapping`: Maps request paths.
- `@RequestBody`: Parses JSON data from HTTP requests.
- `@RequestParam`: Maps HTTP request parameters.
- `@PathVariable`: Extracts path variables from the URL.
- `@ResponseBody`: Converts the return value of a controller method to JSON.
- `@RequestHeader`: Extracts HTTP request header data.
- HTTP method-specific mappings such as `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc.

## 14. What are common annotations in Spring Boot?
**Answer:**  
Common Spring Boot annotations include:
- `@SpringBootApplication`: Combines `@SpringBootConfiguration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan`.
- REST and web-related annotations:
    - `@RestController`, `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc., which simplify Spring MVC configurations.

## 15. What is the MyBatis execution flow?
**Answer:**  
The MyBatis execution flow is as follows:
1. Read the MyBatis configuration file (`mybatis-config.xml`).
2. Construct the `SqlSessionFactory`.
3. Use the `SqlSessionFactory` to create an `SqlSession` object.
4. Use the `SqlSession` to interact with the database.
5. The `Executor` executes the logic defined in the Mapper's `MappedStatement`.
6. Perform input parameter mapping.
7. Map the results to output objects.

## 16. Does MyBatis support lazy loading?
**Answer:**  
Yes, MyBatis supports lazy loading. This means data is fetched only when it is needed. Lazy loading can be enabled or disabled by setting the `lazyLoadingEnabled` configuration property.

## 17. What is the underlying principle of lazy loading in MyBatis?
**Answer:**  
The underlying principle of lazy loading is based on **CGLIB dynamic proxies**:
1. MyBatis creates a proxy object using CGLIB.
2. When a method on the proxy is called, it checks if the required data is loaded.
3. If the data is not loaded, MyBatis executes the appropriate SQL query.
4. The results are loaded into the proxy object, and the method call proceeds.

## 18. Have you used MyBatis' first- and second-level caches?
**Answer:**  
Yes:
- **First-Level Cache:**  
  This is a session-scoped cache that stores query results in memory using a `PerpetualCache` backed by a `HashMap`. It is enabled by default.
- **Second-Level Cache:**  
  This is a namespace-scoped cache that must be explicitly enabled. It is also based on `PerpetualCache` and uses `HashMap` for storage.

## 19. When does MyBatis' second-level cache clear its data?
**Answer:**  
The second-level cache clears data in the following situations:
1. When any `insert`, `update`, or `delete` operation is performed within the same namespace.
2. The namespace's cache is invalidated, and all related cached `select` queries are removed.
