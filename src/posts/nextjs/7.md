# API Routes in NextJS

## Craete a folder named `api` in the `pages` folder directory of your project.

Inside the `api` folder, create a new file named `hello.js`.

```javascript
export default function handler(req, res) {
    res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello from API!' });
}
```

This is a simple API route that returns a JSON object with a message.

To use this API route, you can make a GET request to `http://localhost:3000/api/hello`. The response will be a JSON object with the message "Hello from API!".
if you want send a request from the front end, the url should be api/hello.
