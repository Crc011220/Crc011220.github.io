# React Context API
React Context API is a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It provides a way to share values between components without having to explicitly wire them together.

## Basic Usage
To use React Context API, we need to create a context object using the `createContext` function. Then, we can use the `Provider` component to wrap our top-level component and pass the context object as a prop.
```jsx
import React, { createContext, useState } from 'react';
const MyContext = createContext();
function App() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    return (
        <MyContext.Provider value={{ count, setCount }}>
            <Child />
        </MyContext.Provider>
    );
    }
}
```
In the `Child` component, we can use the `useContext` hook to access the context object and its values.
```jsx
import React, { useContext } from 'react';
function Child() {
    const { count, setCount } = useContext(MyContext);
    return (
        <div>
            <p>Count: {count}</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
}
```
In this example, we create a `MyContext` object and pass it as a prop to the `Provider` component. In the `Child` component, we use the `useContext` hook to access the `count` and `setCount` values from the `MyContext` object. We can then update the `count` state by calling the `setCount` function.
