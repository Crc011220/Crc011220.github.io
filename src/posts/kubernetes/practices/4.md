# Pods

::: info
In YAML, the `-` symbol is used when a key contains a list (multiple items). In your example, `env` is a list, and each environment variable (a combination of `name` and `value`) is an object in the `env` list. Therefore, you need to use `-` before each environment variable.

### Creating resources（pod here）

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-demo
  labels:
    type: app
    version: 1.0.0
  namespace: 'default'
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.7.9
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    command:
      - nginx
      - g
      - 'daemon off;'
    workingDir: /usr/share/nginx/html
    ports:
      - name: http
        containerPort: 80
        protocol: TCP
    env:
      - name: JVM_OPTS
        value: '-Xms128m -Xmx128m'
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 100m
        memory: 128Mi
      limits:
        cpu: 200m
        memory: 256Mi
    restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

### You can see that the Pod was created successfully. However, using kubectl get po shows an error. After modifying the Nginx version to latest and changing the command to ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"], the Pod started successfully.

## In Kubernetes, probes are used to monitor the health and status of containers running within a pod. There are three main types of probes:
### Liveness Probe: Determines if a container is running. If it fails, Kubernetes restarts the container.
### Readiness Probe: Checks if a container is ready to handle requests. If it fails, the container is removed from the service endpoints.
### Startup Probe: Ensures the application has started successfully. This is useful for applications that take a long time to initialize, preventing false failures in the liveness and readiness probe

## Example with Probes

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
name: nginx-demo
labels:
type: app
version: 1.0.0
namespace: 'default'
spec:
containers:
- name: nginx
  image: nginx:latest
  imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  startupProbe:  # Startup Probe to check if the app starts
  httpGet:
  path: /index.html
  port: 80
  failureThreshold: 3
  periodSeconds: 10
  successThreshold: 1
  timeoutSeconds: 5
  readinessProbe:  # Readiness Probe to check if the app is ready
  httpGet:
  path: /index.html
  port: 80
  failureThreshold: 3
  periodSeconds: 10
  successThreshold: 1
  timeoutSeconds: 5
  livenessProbe:  # Liveness Probe to check if the app is alive
  httpGet:
  path: /index.html
  port: 80
  failureThreshold: 3
  periodSeconds: 10
  successThreshold: 1
  timeoutSeconds: 5
  command: ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
  workingDir: /usr/share/nginx/html
  ports:
    - name: http
      containerPort: 80
      protocol: TCP
      env:
    - name: JVM_OPTS
      value: '-Xms128m -Xmx128m'
      resources:
      requests:
      cpu: 100m
      memory: 128Mi
      limits:
      cpu: 200m
      memory: 256Mi
      restartPolicy: OnFailure
```
::: info
### initialDelaySeconds: 60 — The initialization time before starting the probe.
### timeoutSeconds: 2 — The timeout duration for the probe.
### periodSeconds: 5 — The interval between each probe check.
### successThreshold: 1 — The number of successful checks required to consider the probe successful.
### failureThreshold: 2 — The number of failed checks required to consider the probe failed.

# Pods Lifecycle

A Pod in Kubernetes goes through several states during its lifecycle. Understanding the lifecycle helps in managing Pods effectively. Here's a breakdown of the key stages:

## Pending:

- A Pod is created, but it is not yet scheduled or running on a node. This state can occur due to scheduling delays or if resources are not available on the nodes.
- The Pod transitions from the Pending state when it is assigned to a node and the containers are initialized.

## Running:

- Once a Pod has been scheduled on a node, and its containers have been started, the Pod enters the Running state.
- In this state, the containers are actively running, and the Pod is ready to serve requests (unless it’s waiting for initialization or readiness checks).

## Succeeded:

- The Pod has successfully completed its work and all its containers have exited with a zero exit status.
- Pods with a `restartPolicy` set to `Never` or `OnFailure` will enter this state once the containers complete successfully.

## Failed:

- This state occurs when the Pod’s containers have terminated with a non-zero exit code and Kubernetes is unable to restart them based on the configured restart policy.
- The Pod will remain in this state unless manually deleted or configured for restart.

## Unknown:

- This state means that the kubelet cannot determine the state of the Pod due to issues communicating with the node.
- This could happen in scenarios where the node is not responding.

## Example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-demo
  labels:
    type: app
    version: 1.0.0
  namespace: default
spec:
  terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30  # Grace period for termination (in seconds)
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:latest
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    command: ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
    workingDir: /usr/share/nginx/html
    ports:
      - name: http
        containerPort: 80
        protocol: TCP
    env:
      - name: JVM_OPTS
        value: '-Xms128m -Xmx128m'
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 100m
        memory: 128Mi
      limits:
        cpu: 200m
        memory: 256Mi
    restartPolicy: Always
    lifecycle:
      postStart:  # Executes after the container starts
        exec:
          command:
            - "/bin/sh"
            - "-c"
            - "echo 'Container has started successfully!'"
      preStop:   # Executes before the container is terminated
        exec:
          command:
            - "/bin/sh"
            - "-c"
            - "echo 'Container is stopping, performing cleanup tasks...'"
```

### terminationGracePeriodSeconds: This parameter defines the amount of time Kubernetes will wait for a pod to gracefully shut down before forcibly terminating the containers. In this example, it’s set to 30 seconds. This means that when the pod is deleted, it will have 30 seconds to finish its cleanup tasks before it is terminated.

### preStop lifecycle hook: The preStop hook is executed before the container is terminated. In this example, the hook performs a cleanup task (simulated by the sleep 10 command, which represents some cleanup process like database connection closure or releasing external resources). This cleanup will occur within the grace period of 30 seconds.
