# East-West Traffic vs North-South Traffic

**East-West Traffic** and **North-South Traffic** are terms commonly used in computer networking and data centers to describe the direction and type of data flow.

## 1. East-West Traffic
**East-West Traffic** refers to the communication between different servers, containers, or application services within the same data center or private network. Typically, it describes the flow of data between services or applications.

- **Characteristics**:
    - Internal network traffic
    - Occurs within the data center or same local area network (LAN)
    - Typically does not pass through external firewalls or external routers
    - Mainly service-to-service communication in microservices architectures, such as database-to-application server communication
    - Example: Communication between web servers and database servers or communication between Pods in Kubernetes

- **Example**:
    - If a user accesses a website via a browser, the traffic from the browser (client) to the web server is usually North-South traffic. However, if the web server makes a request to the database server for data, that communication is East-West traffic.

## 2. North-South Traffic
**North-South Traffic** refers to the flow of data between external networks (like the internet or clients) and a data center or cloud service, or vice versa.

- **Characteristics**:
    - External-to-internal communication traffic
    - Typically passes through load balancers, gateways, firewalls, etc.
    - Mainly traffic related to user requests to access services
    - Example: User accesses a web application, or API requests come from the outside world to the internal services

- **Example**:
    - For example, when a user accesses an online shopping website through their browser, the traffic from the userâ€™s device (client) to the web application is North-South traffic. This request may go through an external load balancer, entering the data center and reaching the web server.

## Summary:
- **East-West Traffic** happens internally within the data center or private network, and it typically involves communication between services.
- **North-South Traffic** occurs between external clients (e.g., users) and the data center, usually involving interactions between public networks and internal services.
