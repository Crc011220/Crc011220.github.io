# Full Update vs. Rolling Update

Full updates and rolling updates are two common methods for system updates, particularly in service deployment and application upgrades. Hereâ€™s a comparison of their differences and characteristics:

## 1. Full Update
- **Definition**: A full update replaces all service instances or system components at once during the update process.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Completed Quickly**: Since everything is replaced at once, the update process is typically fast.
  - **Service Interruption**: This often requires a short downtime, causing the service to be unavailable (unless a blue-green deployment or similar technique is used to minimize disruption).
  - **Higher Risk**: Replacing everything at once can make rollback difficult if issues arise.
- **Suitable Scenarios**: Ideal for smaller systems, updates during low-traffic periods, or applications that do not require high business continuity.

## 2. Rolling Update
- **Definition**: A rolling update gradually replaces service instances, updating the system in phases.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Phased Update**: Only a subset of instances is updated at a time, with the remaining instances continuing to serve traffic. After one batch is updated, the next batch is updated.
  - **No Service Interruption**: Since some instances are always available, the service typically remains uninterrupted.
  - **Lower Risk**: Allows for real-time monitoring during the update. If issues occur, the update can be paused or rolled back.
- **Suitable Scenarios**: Suitable for systems with high availability requirements, especially in microservices architectures or containerized environments (e.g., Kubernetes), where the service must remain available during the update process.

## Summary
- **Full Update** is simpler and faster but has downtime risks and higher rollback costs.
- **Rolling Update** is preferred for systems requiring high availability, allowing updates without downtime and enabling easier monitoring and rollback.
